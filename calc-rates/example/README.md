# calc-rates examples

This is a quick example showing use of the configuration file `calc-rates.ron` which specifies how to calculate rates from multiple result sets.

# Getting started
Just run `calc-rates calc` here which by default reads in configuration file `calc-rates.ron`.
If multiple configuration files are desired, specify `calc-rates calc --path <YOUR-PATH-HERE>`.

If stuck, try passing `--help` with the command.
If unsure how to edit the calc-rates.ron file, make a change then try running `calc-rates calc` might give a helpful message.
